 * The activity moves pallets from position to position on a conveyor segment at a linear rate. 
 * It checks to see if the next position in a ConveyorSegment is free or that the pallet in that position is in motion, 
 * then schedules a move. If the pallet is at the end of a conveyor segment, 
 * then it checks to see if the pallet is fully processed before evaluating the other conditions and scheduling a move.
